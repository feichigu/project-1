### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Emotion patterns in different lyrics genres
+ This project is conducted by [Feichi Gu]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] We know that lyrics will contain countless emotions, anticipatoin, joy, sadness and so on. But what will they differ in different lyrics genres, and also in different time period? Today, my main theme is to use sentimental analysis available in R package to explore such emotion patterns and get some interesting findings. 
Basiclly, my analysis will be conducted in three directions:
1. Compare emotions contained in words in different lyrics genres
2. Compare emotions contained in top200 most frequent words in different genres
3. Compare emotions contained in words for different time period of certain genres
